## Overview

NetPractice is a networking exercise designed to help you understand and practice basic networking concepts and configurations. The goal of this project is to improve your understanding of IP addressing, subnetting, and routing, which are fundamental skills for any network engineer.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of IP addressing and subnetting.
- Learn how to configure network interfaces.
- Practice creating and managing routing tables.
- Develop troubleshooting skills for network issues.

## Key Concepts

1. **IP Addressing**: Learn about IPv4 addresses, the structure of an IP address, and the concept of network masks.
2. **Subnetting**: Understand how to divide a larger network into smaller subnetworks, calculate subnet masks, and determine the number of hosts in a subnet.
3. **Routing**: Study how routers direct traffic between different networks and how to configure routing tables.
4. **Network Interfaces**: Get hands-on experience configuring network interfaces on different devices.
5. **TCP/IP**: Explore the TCP/IP protocol suite and its role in modern networking.

## Project Tasks

Throughout the NetPractice project, you will be required to complete various tasks such as:

- Assigning IP addresses to devices.
- Creating subnets and determining appropriate subnet masks.
- Configuring routing tables to enable communication between different subnets.
