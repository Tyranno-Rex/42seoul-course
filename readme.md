# 42seoul Project Collection

This repository contains all the projects I completed during my time at 42seoul. Each project helped me develop a deeper understanding of various programming concepts and improve my skills. Below is a brief overview of each project.

## Projects

### libft
A custom implementation of several standard C library functions. This project serves as a foundation for many other projects by providing essential utilities.

### get_next_line
A function that reads a line from a file descriptor. This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation and file I/O operations in C.

### ft_printf
An implementation of the printf function in C, supporting various format specifiers and flags. This project emphasizes variadic functions and format string parsing.

### born2beroot
A system administration project where I configured a virtual machine to specific standards, focusing on system security and user management.

### exam-rank-02
An exam that tests the fundamental skills learned in the first projects, including basic C programming and problem-solving abilities.

### so_long
A small 2D game built using the MiniLibX library. This project involves graphics programming, game logic, and user interaction.

### minitalk
A small client-server communication program using UNIX signals. This project emphasizes inter-process communication and signal handling.

### push_swap
A sorting algorithm visualization project. The goal is to sort a stack of numbers with the least number of operations using two stacks.

### exam-rank-03
An exam that tests more advanced programming skills, focusing on data structures and algorithms.

### philosophers
A simulation of the classic "Dining Philosophers" problem, demonstrating concepts of concurrency, threading, and synchronization.

### minishell
A simple shell implementation in C. This project covers command parsing, process management, and signal handling.

### exam-rank-04
An exam testing the ability to implement more complex programs and handle advanced programming scenarios.

### netpractice
A network configuration and troubleshooting project, focusing on understanding and setting up network protocols and services.

### cpp-module-04
A project in C++ that delves into object-oriented programming, including inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes.

### cube3d
A 3D game using raycasting, inspired by Wolfenstein 3D. This project covers graphics programming, game development, and mathematical computations.

### cpp-module-09
A C++ project focusing on advanced concepts such as templates, STL, and metaprogramming.

### ft_irc
An implementation of an IRC server in C++, handling multiple clients and various IRC commands. This project emphasizes networking, concurrency, and protocol implementation.
