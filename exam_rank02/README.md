# Exam - Rank02

## Introduction

This exam consists of solving two out of four possible problems. Candidates randomly receive two problems to solve within the given time frame. Problem either `ft_printf` or `get_next_line`, and either `inter` or `union`.

## Problems

### 1. ft_printf

Implement the function `ft_printf` which mimics the behavior of the standard C library function `printf`, providing formatted output to the standard output stream or another specified destination.

### 2. get_next_line

Implement the function `get_next_line` which reads a line from a file descriptor. This function must handle multiple file descriptors and efficiently manage memory allocation and deallocation.

### 3. inter

Implement the program `inter` which takes two strings and displays, without repetition, the characters that appear in both strings, sorted by ASCII value.

### 4. union

Implement the program `union` which takes two strings and displays their union, without repetition, sorted by ASCII value.


## Additional Notes

- Carefully read each problem statement and ensure understanding of requirements before starting implementation.
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures to achieve optimal performance.
- Debug and test your solutions thoroughly before submission.
